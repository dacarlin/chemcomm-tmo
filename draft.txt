Next, we attemptted to shed some light on the varying specificities using macromolecular modeling of the mutants. Using Rosetta, we build homology models of the mutants using the crystal structures of three closely-related proteins. While this is not a replacement for determining the crystal structure, previous work has shown that Rosetta models are accurate enough to deduce why some of the evolved mutants showed activity on ethene while the wild type protein does not. 

Our homology models revealed an active site pocket around the uncoordinated orbitals of the diiron center in the wild type large enough to admit indole. In the mutants A113F and V113F, the active site pocket is additionally packed and closed down compared to wild type such that it will not admit an indole but would easily admit a small nonpolar species such as ethene. We believe that this is the basis for the specific activity of the mutants on ethene.
