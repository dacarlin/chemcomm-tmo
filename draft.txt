Communication: enzymatic synthesis of oxirane
=============================================

Commercial production of ethylene oxide, an important commodity chemical, began in 1914 and by 2009 had reached 20 million tons annually. Currently, a multi-unit industrial process in which gaseous ethylene and oxygen are reacted over silver catalyst at high temperature and pressure is used to produce ethylene oxide (IUPAC name: oxirane) from ethylene (IUPAC name: ethene). 

Oxiraneâ€™s stance as a key raw material which satisfies demand for 10% of worldwide ethene production justifies the invention of better methods of production. 

Biological catalysts are becoming the tool of choice for synthetic reactions because of their selectivity and ability to perform reactions of interest under mild conditions. The epoxidation of ethene to yield oxirane is an example of a reaction particularly suited to biological catalysis.

In nature, the epoxidation of alkenes is carried out alkene monooxygenases. The expression of these enzymes in an industrial host such as Escherichia coli has to date been an elusive goal. 

Previous directed-evolution studies (Wood 2002) developed a library of 26,705 mutants of toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) from *Burkholderia cepacia* for the bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes in wastewater. Wood found one mutant, TOM V106A, that degraded trichloroethene about twice as fast as the wild type enzyme. 

We assayed a subset of the directed-evolution library against ethene to determine if the enzyme was capable of oxidizing this compound to oxirane. Using whole cells sealed in glass vials under 1.5% ethene atmosphere with constant rocking, we found that some of the mutants were able to oxidize ethene to oxirane.

We found that wild type TOM showed no activity on ethene. We found no difference in degradation rate on ethene for TOM V106A, which Wood has shown to degrade trichloroethene about twice as fast as wild type. 

Similarly, TOM V106P+A113G, where V106 and A113 have been replaced by similar small amino acids, showed no increased activity on ethene. Mutants TOM V106R+A113W, TOM V106Q+A113Q, GTOM 103S+A107T, TOM A113H, and TOM V106H+A113S, in which the small, nonpolar residues at 106 and/or 133 have been replaced by polar residues, showed a range of modest activity on ethene.   

TOM mutants A113V, V106F, and A113F, where V106 and A113 are replaced by large nonpolar amino acids, showed dramatic gains in activity on ethene.

The basis for specificity could be the steric occlusion of larger substrates (such as indole [Wood 2001]) from the active site and the favorable molecular interaction between the pi bonds of ethene and the sidechain of phenylalanine. 

To investigate this hypothesis, we build homology models of the mutants using the crystal structures of three closely-related proteins (Song 2013). While this is not a replacement for determining the crystal structure, previous work has shown that Rosetta models are accurate enough to deduce why some of the evolved mutants showed activity on ethene while the wild type protein does not. 

Our homology models revealed an active site pocket around the uncoordinated orbitals of the diiron center in the wild type large enough to admit indole. In the mutants A113F and V113F, the active site pocket is additionally packed and closed down compared to wild type such that it will not admit an indole but would easily admit a small nonpolar species such as ethene. We believe that this is the basis for the specific activity of the mutants on ethene. 

In conclusion, we report synthesis of oxirane from ethene using a biological catalyst derived from directed evolution on a related substrate. This finding opens the door to the industrial synthesis of oxirane using mild conditions.
