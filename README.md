Introduction

"Ethylene oxide is an important raw material used in the manufacture of chemical derivatives that are the basis for major consumer goods in virtually all industrialized countries." (IARC 2008) Commercial production of ethylene oxide began in 1914. In 2009, global production rose 5% to 20 million tons. A multi-unit industrial process wherein gaseous ethylene and oxygen are reacted over silver catalyst at high temperature and pressure (300 C and 3 MPa are common) accounts for all 20 million tons of global production. Continual replacement of the silver catalyst and scrubbers is necessary. satisfies demand for 10% of worldwide ethene production. Even the latest abd best-developed industrial methods can only promide a catalytic lifetime of 3 years (biological catalysts can be used forever) and, based on Kilty, maximum degree of conversion is 85.7%.

Biological catalysts are becoming the tool of choice for synthetic
reactions because of their selectivity and ability to perform reactions of
interest under mild, nontoxic conditions. The epoxidation of ethene to yield oxirane is an example of a reaction particularly suited to biological catalysis. Theoretical yeild is 100%, biological catalysts are indefatigable and last indefinitely, and the low temp mild conditions are conducive to its handling as a refrigerated liquid (virtually all industrially-produced oxirane is handled this way). These conditions also promote the formation of ethylene glycol, a transformation that consumes 75% of oxirane produced globally each year. TMOs could easily be combined with epoxide hydrolases to produce ethylene glycol directly from ethene.

We identified a suitable biological catalyst to perform the epoxidation of ethene through a literature search. Previous reports have shown that toluene-o-xylene monooxygenase (T4MO) of *Pseudomonas stutzeri* degraded binary mixtures of chlorinated ethenes. Based on the proposed enzymatic mechanism, we hypothesized that this enzyme and its close homolog from B. cepacia would also show specific activity on unsubstituted ethene to yield oxirane. 

To test our hypothesis that this enzyme would have specific acitivity on ethene, we assayed for ethene degradation and oxirane production in whole cells expresing T4MO. After preliminary findings of activity, a small library (n=18) of mutants generated by shuffling mutagenesis (Wood 2001) was tested for ethene as assayed by GC-FID. 

Results and discussion
----------------------

We found a variety of activites on ethene, as pictured. Nearly-complete degradation of millimolar concentrations of ethene was observed within 24 hours in the T4MO wild type. Wild type TOM showed no activity. However, several of the mutants that had undergone directed evolution showed activity. 

A most interesting result was that a single amino acid substituion (phenylalanie for alanine at position 113 of $gene-name) renders TOM as active as T4MO on ethene. Other mutants that showed increased activity compared to wild time TOM all contained mutations where a small amino acid has been replaced by a larger one, consistent with the placement of these residues in the crystal structure (there's the argument for including a drawing of the active site).

A subset of mutants that showed complete degradation of ethene after 24 hours was tested to determine the reaction rate. The fastest mutant, TOM A113F, degraded 0.62 mM ethene (= 0.62 umol) in 220 minutes.

Here we report the use of a directed evolution approach to improve the activity of toluene-o-monooxygenase on gaseous unsubstituted ethene. These findings will be useful in x, y, z.
