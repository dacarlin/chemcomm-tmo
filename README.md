Introduction
------------

"Ethylene oxide is an important raw material used in the manufacture of
chemical derivatives that are the basis for major consumer goods in
virtually all industrialized countries." (IARC 2008) Commercial
production began in 1914 and by 2009, had reached 20 million tons annually.
Currently, a multi-unit industrial process in which gaseous ethylene and
oxygen are reacted over silver catalyst at high temperature and pressure
(300 C and 3 MPa are common) is used to produce ethylene oxide (IUPAC name: oxirane) from ethylene. Even with the latest and best-developed industrial methods,
continual replacement of the silver catalyst and scrubbers is
necessary and the maximum degree of conversion is 85.7% (the rest is lost to carbon monoxide which must be scrubbed). Ethylene oxide's stance as a key raw material which satisfies demand for 10% of worldwide ethene production justifies the invention of better methods for the production of oxirane from ethylene. 

Biological catalysts are becoming the tool of choice for synthetic
reactions because of their selectivity and ability to perform reactions of
interest under mild, nontoxic conditions. The epoxidation of ethene to
yield oxirane is an example of a reaction particularly suited to
biological catalysis. Theoretical yeild is 100%, and, in constrast
to current industrual catalysts, biological catalysts are
indefatigable and last indefinitely as they are constantly being produced
by microrganisms, and the low temp mild conditions are
conducive to its handling as a refrigerated liquid (virtually all
industrially-produced oxirane is handled this way). These conditions also
promote the formation of ethylene glycol, a transformation that consumes
75% of oxirane produced globally each year. TMOs could easily be combined
in a pathway with a suitable epoxide hydrolase to produce ethylene glycol directly from ethene. (Possible future grant/paper? 1EHY, a 294 AA epoxide hydrolase from agrobacterium radiobacter ad1, has been expressed in Escherichia coli bl21(de3) for crystallization.)

![Scheme 1](s1.png). Reaction scheme. 

We identified a suitable biological catalyst to perform the epoxidation of
ethene through a literature search. Previous reports have shown that
toluene-o-xylene monooxygenase (T4MO) of *Pseudomonas stutzeri* degraded
binary mixtures of chlorinated ethenes. Based on the proposed enzymatic
mechanism, we hypothesized that this enzyme and its close homolog from B.
cepacia would also show specific activity on unsubstituted ethene to yield
oxirane. 

To test our hypothesis that this enzyme would have specific acitivity on
ethene, we assayed for ethene degradation and oxirane production in whole
cells expresing T4MO. After preliminary findings of activity, a small
library (n=18) of mutants generated by shuffling mutagenesis (Wood 2001)
was tested for ethene as assayed by GC-FID. 

Results and discussion
----------------------

We found a variety of activites on ethene, as pictured. Nearly-complete
degradation of millimolar concentrations of ethene was observed within 24
hours in the T4MO wild type. Wild type TOM showed no activity. However,
several of the mutants that had undergone directed evolution showed
activity. 

TOM mutants TOM Green and TOM V106P, A113G, where V106 and A113 have been
replaced by similar small amino acids, showed no increased activity on
ethylene. 

TOM mutants where V106 and A113 were replaced by various large polar amino acids and A113 showed modest gains in activity on ethylene. 

TOM mutants where V106 and A113 were replaced by large nonpolar amino
acids showed dramatic gains in activity on ethylene. 

In particular, two individual single amino acid substituions, A113F and
V106F, showed activity comparable to wild type T4MO. 

(I think there's an argument for including a drawing of the active site
with A113 and V106 labeled.)

A subset of mutants that showed complete degradation of ethene after 24
hours was tested to determine the reaction rate. The fastest mutant, TOM
A113F, degraded 0.62 mM ethene (= 0.62 umol) in 220 minutes (convert to
nmol/min/mg protein to be consistent with Wood 2001).

Here we report the use of a directed evolution approach to improve the
activity of toluene-o-monooxygenase on gaseous unsubstituted ethene. These
findings will be useful in x, y, z.
