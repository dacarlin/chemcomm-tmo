Introduction
------------

Biological catalysts are becoming the tool of choice for synthetic
reactions because of their selectivity and ability to perform the chemistry 
of interest under mild, nontoxic conditions. One example of a synthesis
particularly suited to biological catalysis is the conversion of ethene, a
petrochemical waste product, into oxirane, a prechiral synthetic precursor.
Current techniques to produce oxirane from ethene are deficient in the
following ways: x, y, and z. 

Scheme 1. Hypothesized reaction scheme. 

Previous reports have shown that toluene-o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) of Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1 degraded binary mixtures of chlorinated ethenes. We hypothesized that this enzyme would also show specific activity on unsubstituted ethene. To test our hypothesis, we repurposed a previously-generated library of TMO enzymes that had undergone directed evolution. "because the breakdown of chlorinated aliphatics yields no carbon or energy for the cell and because the breakdown intermediates, such as TCE epox- ide, are toxic (44), TOM will never evolve naturally to break- down these compounds faster." Thus the directed evolution approach.  

Results
-------

We found that some T4MO and TOM variants showed activity on ethene.
