Introduction 
------------

"Ethylene oxide is an important raw material used in the manufacture of
chemical derivatives that are the basis for major consumer goods in
virtually all industrialized countries." (IARC 2008) Commercial production
began in 1914 and by 2009, had reached 20 million tons annually.
Currently, a multi-unit industrial process in which gaseous ethylene and
oxygen are reacted over silver catalyst at high temperature and pressure
(300 C and 3 MPa are common) is used to produce ethylene oxide (IUPAC name:
oxirane) from ethylene. Even with the latest and best-developed industrial
methods, continual replacement of the silver catalyst and scrubbers is
necessary and the maximum degree of conversion is 85.7% (the rest is lost
to carbon monoxide which must be scrubbed). Ethylene oxide's stance as
a key raw material which satisfies demand for 10% of worldwide ethene
production justifies the invention of better methods for the production of
oxirane from ethylene. 

Biological catalysts are becoming the tool of choice for synthetic
reactions because of their selectivity and ability to perform reactions of
interest under mild, nontoxic conditions. The epoxidation of ethene to
yield oxirane is an example of a reaction particularly suited to biological
catalysis. Theoretical yeild is 100%, and, in constrast to current
industrial catalysts, biological catalysts are indefatigable and last
indefinitely as they are constantly being produced by microrganisms, and
the low temp mild conditions are conducive to its handling as
a refrigerated liquid (virtually all industrially-produced oxirane is
handled this way). These conditions also promote the formation of ethylene
glycol, a transformation that consumes 75% of oxirane produced globally
each year. 

![Scheme 1](s1.png) Reaction scheme. 

In nature, the epoxidation of alkenes is carried out by a group of alkene
monooxygenases that use molecular oxygen and NADH. The expression of these
enzymes in an industrial host such as *Escherichia coli* has to date been
an elusive goal. We performed a sequence homology search to identify
candidate enzymes which had been shown to function in *E. coli* and found
toluene-o-xylene monooxygenase (T4MO) of *Pseudomonas stutzeri* and
toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) of *Burkholderia cepacia G4*. These two
closely-related (identity: xx% and xx% to AMO) enzymes that have been shown
to degrade chlorinated ethenes, and a 2.1 A crystal structure of T4MO is
available (Sazinsky 2004). Based on the proposed enzymatic mechanism, we
hypothesized that these enzymes would oxidize ethene to yield oxirane. 

To test our hypothesis, we assayed ethene degradation and oxirane production in whole cells expressing wild type enzyme and various mutants. A small library (n=18) of mutants generated by shuffling mutagenesis by Wood (2001)
that had undergone directed evolution for degradation chlorinated
ethenes was chosen as our test set. We hypothesized that these mutants that had undergone directed evolution for chlorinated ethene degradation would also degrade unsubstituted ethene. 

Ethane and oxirane are both gases at room temperature and standard
pressure, so we performed our assays in sealed glass vials containing 0.5
mL of cell culture and 1.5 mL of headspace. Ethene was detected using an
Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector. 

![Figure 2](fig2.png) Ethene degradation by wild type TOM (TOM) and various mutants. 

[Note: 1000 nm of ethene is degraded over 100 minutes, but how many
mgs of protein are there in the 1 mL vials? ]

Wild type TOM showed no activity on ethene. Some mutants showed modest
increases in our assays, and two completely degraded the gaseous ethene
over 24 hours. 

We found a variety of activites on ethene, as pictured. Nearly-complete
degradation of millimolar concentrations of ethene was observed within 24
hours in the T4MO wild type. Wild type TOM showed no activity. However,
several of the mutants that had undergone directed evolution showed
activity. 

Wood reported that TOM V106A degraded TCE about twice as fast as
wild type TOM (Wood 2002), and we found no difference in degradation rate
on ethene for this mutant. 

Similarly, TOM V106P+A113G, where V106 and A113 have been
replaced by similar small amino acids, showed no increased activity on
ethene. 

TOM mutants V106R+A113W, V106Q+A113Q, G103S+A107T, A113H, V106H+A113S,
were the small, nonpolar residues at 106 and/or 133 have been replaced by
polar residues, showed a range of modest activity on ethene. 

TOM mutants A113V, V106F, and A113F, where V106 and A113 are replaced by
large nonpolar amino acids, showed dramatic gains in activity on ethylene
(measured rate compared to WT not meaningful because wild does not show
activity? What is measured rate?). The basis for specificy could be
explained by two mutations to the lumen of the active site pocket
(described in Wood 2001 (11) as a channel). By stericly occluding larger
substrates, these large nonpolar residues could favor two-carbon ethene.
/cut Previous work by Mitchell (2003) suggests a mechanism for the action of
this enzyme based on studies with deuterated toluene in which the size and
shape of the active site pocket is crucial to catalysis. Compare the shape
of the pocket in the wild type enzyme to the single amino acid switch
mutant TOM V106F, which showed xxx activity on oxirane, with the single
amino acid switch mutant TOM V106A, which showed no improvement on oxirane.
The phe at 113 creates a favorable molecular interaction between ethene and
the phe aromatic sidechain. endcut/

Similarly, TOM A113V shows mild improvement on oxirane
compared to wild type, while TOM A113F shows dramatic improvement. Modeling
the mutants suggests occlusion of the substrate binding pocket by phe. Such
occlusion could account for higher specificity for oxirane by sterically
excluding other substrates, such as indole, shown to bind in the active
site (Wood 2001). 

[Calculate rates in Wood's units and include in previous paragraph] A subset of mutants that showed complete degradation of ethene after 24
hours was tested to determine the reaction rate. The fastest mutant, TOM
A113F, degraded 0.62 mM ethene (= 0.62 umol) in 220 minutes (convert to
nmol/min/mg protein to be consistent with Wood 2001).
