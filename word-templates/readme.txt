RSC Word 2010 Template (Version 1)

Basic Principles

The ".dotx" file in this archive is a styles-based Microsoft Word 2010 template designed to mimic the look of a journal printed page. All the necessary font size, style and spacing values are pre-set in the template and shouldn’t need changing or modification.  Changing the font size, paragraph spacing, page borders or any other presentation parameter will result in the final page layout being incorrect, and as such the document produced will not be an accurate reflection of the length of the final published paper.

It is highly recommended that the document is viewed in "Print Layout" mode, as this provides the best way of determining the length of the manuscript. 

Note: The formatting data for a paragraph is "stored" in the paragraph character (¶) at the end of the paragraph. If this is deleted or overtyped, the formatting is lost.

To open a new document:

Insert the template ".dotx" file into your Word templates directory (in Word, click on the File tab, press the "Options" button at the bottom of the dialog box, click "Advanced", scroll to the bottom of the options and click on the "File Locations..." to find the path to your User Templates directory, then copy the file into that directory). Then, from the File tab select "New", click on "My Templates", and select the RSC template.
